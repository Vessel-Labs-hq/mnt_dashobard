This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## üî¨ Atomic Design

This project uses Atomic Design for it's Components. Here are several resources for Atomic Design if you are unfamiliar:

- [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- [Atomic Design - How To Make Web and UI Design Easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A33dmp17E)


## UI Component Library
- [Radix Ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/getting-started)

## üñ•Ô∏è Local development

To install the application:

```shell
npm ci
```

To start a local copy of the app on port `3000`:

```shell
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
