This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## üî¨ Atomic Design

This project uses Atomic Design for it's Components. Here are several resources for Atomic Design if you are unfamiliar:

- [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- [Atomic Design - How To Make Web and UI Design Easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A33dmp17E)


## UI Component Library
- [Radix Ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/getting-started)

## üñ•Ô∏è Local development

To install the application:

```shell
npm ci
```

To start a local copy of the app on port `3000`:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## üìô Storybook

This Project uses [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to test and document Ui components

### Run it locally

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### üé® Code linting

To check the code and styles quality, use the following command:

```shell
npm run lint
```

This will also display during development, but not break on errors.

To fix the linting errors, use the following command:

```shell
npm run format
```

### üöÄ Production deployment

A production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.

```shell
npm run build
```



[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
